\subsection{Course Description}

\textbf{MAT 731 Homological Algebra}: Projective and injective resolutions, Tor and Ext, flatness, homology, derived categories, spectral sequences.

\subsection{Disclaimer}

These notes were taken in Spring 2015 in a course taught by Professor Claudia Miller. In some places, notation/material has been changed or added. Any errors in this text should be attributed to the typist -- Caleb McWhorter -- and not the instructor or any referenced text. 

\subsection{Assumptions}

Unless otherwise stated, all modules will be considered to be left $R$-modules. All rings are assumed to have unity. For ring homomorphisms $\varphi: R \rightarrow S$, it is assumed that $\varphi(1_R)=1_S$. Finally, all maps are assumed to be $R$-module homomorphisms.
